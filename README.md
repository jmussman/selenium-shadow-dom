# Selenium Shadow Dom

## History

* 10/5/2020 Initial creation

## Introduction

This project consists of JUnit 5 tests using Selenium with custom web elements that use Shadow DOM.

## Notes

Import the project as a Maven project in your IDE.
The application context is "selshadowdom" and the port is 8081 (all configurable in the application.properties file).
Run the application and launch the page from "http://localhost:8081", there is a detailed explanation of the page
and the tests on that page.

Explore and run the JUnit tests to understand how Selenium interacts with elements using a Shadow DOM.

## Contributing

We are always looking for ways to make the template better. But remember: Keep it simple. Keep it minimal. Don't add every single feature just because you can, add a feature when a feature is required.
