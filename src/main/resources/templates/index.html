		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>These three buttons are set up with no Shadow DOM, open-mode Shadow DOM, and closed-mode Shadow DOM.
			The first button has a different background color, because the application.css file applies to it.
			The other two buttons show with their default color backgrounds that they use Shadow DOM to
			block application of the application-wide CSS, which of course is the whole point of Shadow DOM.</p>
		<p>These support these Selenium unit tests:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Selenium can select an element anywhere in the Light DOM (the regular browser DOM).</li>
			<li>Selenium cannot select into the component when there it has a Shadow DOM (this is a negative test).</li>
			<li>Selenium can use JavaScript to find the root node in open-mode, and then find elements descending from that.</li>
			<li>Selenium cannot select the root node in closed-mode (this is a negative test).</li>
			<li>Selenium can inject JavaScript and override the <i>attachShadow</i> method from creating a closed root.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This version uses Selenium 4 alpha.
			Chrome is required, use Chrome 86+ to avoid warnings.
			Of course ChromeDriver needs to be in your environment PATH variable for the tests to work, and
			make sure that your ChromeDriver matches the version of Chrome you are using.</p>
